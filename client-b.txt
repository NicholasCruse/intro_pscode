Task B: Find the Spot
Task: Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer. The customer can move north, south, east, or west.

Hints: Loops, Variables

- I assume that the person asking to map the set location in a large warehouse has the starting location pick out on the north side of the building

- There will be variables for the four cardinal directions such as North, East, West, and South.

- Will will continue to loop until hitting a different direction which will print the number of steps and give them a prompt to choose three options.

- There will be a variable that would hold a word reset so that when the customer made a mistake or traveled to the wrong location they can start back at the entrance.

- It will loop adding a number to the cardinal directions to keep track of how many times a certain direction is picked.

- It will occasionally give a choice between the number 1 or 2 for 1 being reset, 2 for continuation on the path, and 3 for when they arrived at the destination.

- When the customer picks 3 it will have displayed the amount of direction in the order they have started at to the location that they have arrived at.
